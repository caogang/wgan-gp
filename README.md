# WGAN-GP
An pytorch implementation of Paper "Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs".

# Prerequisites

Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
A recent NVIDIA GPU

**A latest master version of Pytorch**

# Progress

- [x] gan_toy.py : Toy datasets (8 Gaussians, 25 Gaussians, Swiss Roll).(**Finished** in 2017.5.8)

- [x] gan_language.py : Character-level language model (Discriminator is using **nn.Conv1d**. Generator is using **nn.Conv1d**. **Finished** in 2017.6.23. Finished in 2017.6.27.)


- [x] gan_mnist.py : MNIST (**Running Results while Finished** in 2017.6.26. Discriminator is using **nn.Conv1d**. Generator is using **nn.Conv1d**.)

- [x] gan_64x64.py: 64x64 architectures(**Running Results while Finished** in 2023.02.21. The main architecture is based on DCGAN.)

- [x] gan_cifar.py: CIFAR-10(**Great thanks to [robotcator](https://github.com/caogang/wgan-gp/pull/18)**)

- Billion Word Language Generation (Using CNN, character-level)

  Some Sample Result after 8699 epochs which is detailed in [sample](imgs/lang_samples_8699.txt)

  I haven't run enough epochs due to that this is very time-comsuming.
